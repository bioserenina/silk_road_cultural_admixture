### The impact of cultural and genetic structure on food choices along the Silk Road

This repository contains the code and results of the paper ["The impact of cultural and genetic structure on food choices along the Silk Road"](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2209311119).

* folder *preprocessing*: quality check, initial preprocessing of the food preferences and clustering of the foods (Python code)
* folder *dimensionality_reduction*: code for pca, mds, tsne and umap
* folder *DAPC*: R code for running the DAPC analysis, plotting the main figures of the paper and for the NNLS analysis
* folder *variance_analyses*: R and bash code for computing variance layers for cultural and genetic data
* folder *data*: this folder contains the files with results of the analyses. In particular, there you can find the individual assignments probability for each cluster (from 4 to 7), the results of the supervised admixture analysis, the groups of foods and the results of the dimensionality reduction techniques.
